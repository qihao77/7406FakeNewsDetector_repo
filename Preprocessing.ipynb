       "'The contrast between the Obama White House and the Trump White House seems to grow more and more stark every single day. While you d struggle to find a real scandal during President Obama s entire two terms, it would be nearly impossible to count the number of scandals currently plaguing the Trump White House.More than that, though, it seems that the staff has given up trying to be professional. During a conference call on Monday, about one of the most pressing issues in international relations, Iran, staffers were heard in the background chatting about things like lesbian blowup dolls. I kid you not.Two reporters, Tara McKelvey of the BBC and Jackie Alemany of CBS both tweeted about the background chatter.During the briefing call on Iran, you could hear an ad in the background: a man seemed to be saying  inflatable dolls  and  a lesbian.  Tara McKelvey (@Tara_Mckelvey) July 18, 2017I may never know what was really said during that call or if I heard things wrong. But I ll certainly remember the sounds   and those words  Tara McKelvey (@Tara_Mckelvey) July 18, 2017Trump WH still struggles w conference calls. V weird OH comment from unmuted caller during Iran briefing:  My inflatable doll is a lesbian.  Jackie Alemany (@JaxAlemany) July 18, 2017This may be the first time Trump staffers were caught talking about sex dolls, but it s not the first time they were caught not taking advantage of the mute button. A conference call on the budget in May was described this way:As Mulvaney attempted to answer questions, open phone lines featuring a crying baby, an intermittent hacking cough, and patriotic hold-music quickly drowned him out. Some reporters eventually unmuted their phones, revolting with laughter and exclamations of disbelief over the line. There has to be a better system,  a reporter on the call complained over the tune of Yankee Doodle Dandy.Source: CBS NewsTrump has been at this for six months now. He brands himself as a great leader and he is extremely critical of the appearances of others (if not his own). The out of control conference calls are an easy thing to fix, yet his staff refuses. That s not leadership. That s chaos, which, if you think about it, is the perfect metaphor for everything Trump.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images'"

       "'KIGALI (Reuters) - A critic of Rwandan President Paul Kagame will appear in court on Friday charged with inciting insurrection and forgery, the prosecutor s office said on Thursday.  Diane Shima Rwigara, a 35-year-old accountant, is the latest political opponent of Kagame to face criminal charges. She was barred from contesting the presidency in an August election he won with 98.8 percent of the vote.  She has repeatedly accused him of stifling dissent and criticized his Rwandan Patriotic Front s tight grip on the country since it fought its way to power to end a genocide that killed more than 800,000 people in 1994.  The Court will examine the serious grounds justifying provisional detention of the suspects,  the prosecutor s office said on Twitter. The office noted that the other two suspects to appear in court are Rwigara s mother Adeline and sister Anne.    The three women have been in detention for around two weeks. They were first taken from their home in the Rwandan capital on Aug. 30 on tax evasion allegations related to the family s tobacco company. That charge was not listed in those filed on Tuesday. Kagame has been widely praised for restoring stability in Rwanda and presiding over a rapid economic recovery after the genocide in the East African nation.  But human rights groups say he has muzzled independent media and suppressed potential democratic opponents. Some critics of the government have been imprisoned or killed. Rwanda last month charged another opposition official and eight others with forming an armed group and seeking to overthrow the government.   With each arrest in Rwanda, fewer and fewer people will dare to speak out against state policy or abuse,   read a Human Rights Watch in a report released last month. '"
